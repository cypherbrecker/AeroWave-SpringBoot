# AeroWave-SpringBoot
AeroWave Spring Boot Project that implements an interface of an airline.
It was a team project.
In this project i made almost all of the backend, except: Delete, Update and the discount roads section.
The frontend part and the update and delete were done by my teammates at the university.


In this simple Java spring project, essentially, the user can register or log in, and after logging in, he can buy a ticket from a suitable point of departure to the point of arrival based on the selected filters, and he has the opportunity to buy discounted trips.
